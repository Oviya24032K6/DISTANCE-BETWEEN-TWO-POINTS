# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
write a python program to find the distance between two points

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
start the program
### Step 2: 
take the given points as variables
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
distance calculation

### Step 5: 
In this step,the program prints the calculated distance with 2 decimal places.
### PROGRAM:
```#Program to find the distance between two points.

import math
x1=10
y1=6
x2=4
y2=2
d=math.sqrt(((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
